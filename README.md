The Social Media Sentiment Analyzer is a real-time web application built with Streamlit, designed to automatically fetch and analyze social media posts from multiple platforms including Twitter (X), LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook.

Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as BERT (via Hugging Face Transformers) and fallback support with TextBlob, the tool determines the sentiment polarity of each post â€” classifying it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral with confidence scores.

The app employs Selenium-based web scraping with cookie-based authentication to securely fetch recent posts in real time, even from logged-in sessions. Each fetched post is cleaned, analyzed, and visually presented with color-coded highlights and statistical summaries. Users can view per-post sentiment, aggregate sentiment distribution charts, and download detailed results as a CSV report.

This tool is useful for brand monitoring, market research, and public opinion tracking, helping users quickly assess how audiences feel about a topic, product, or company across different social platforms.
